# The order for ensuring rbenv and bundler work!
#
#   rbenv install 1.9.3-p194
#   rbenv rehash     # for paranoia's sake
#   rbenv global 1.9.3-p194
#   gem env          # to check that everything was pointing at 1.9 and not the system
#   gem install --no-ri --no-rdoc bundler
#   rbenv rehash     # necessary to load up the bundle executable
#   bundle --path=vendor/bundle
#
#   Note that `bundle env` and `gem env` are your friends
#
#   If bundler finds the wrong ruby, it's most likely because the system
#     bundler binary was installed with the wrong ruby
